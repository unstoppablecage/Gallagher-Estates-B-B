		<h2>The <span class="gold">Gold</span> Standard</h2>
		<p>Did someone say quality service? No, well we're here anyway! For over 17 days Gallagher Estates has been providing state of the art customer service and "satisfaction" to visitors looking to enjoy the serenity of the Blue Mountain region. What guests find so "satisfying" about their stay in Gallagher is the attention to detail. We are commited to make your stay here the best yet, and we are willing to get down and dirty to make that happen!</p>
